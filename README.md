A project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients?ref=lnav) curriculum.

This project wasn't too difficult, but I had some trouble perfecting the navbar. I also learnt more about linear gradients, and background properties.
